Welcome!  I am a PhD candidate in Computer Science at the Center for Language and Speech Processing at Johns Hopkins University.  My research is focused on unsupervised and semi-supervised machine translation, bilingual lexicon induction, multilingual representation learning, and efficient NLP. I am advised by Philipp Koehn. 

Prior to JHU, I completed an MPhil in Advanced Computer Science at Christ's College, University of Cambridge.  My thesis advisor was Helen Yannakoudakis.  I was employed at Google, Inc. in Mountain View, CA from 2013-2017 where I was a Web Solutions Engineer (2015-2017) and Support Specialist for gTech Ads, where I led automation efforts for North America (2013-2015).  I returned to Google in Summer 2020 as an intern at Google Translate. Previously, I completed an Ed.M. in Mind, Brain, and Education at Harvard University, and a B.A. in Psychology/Sociology and French (minor) at Franklin & Marshall College in Lancaster, PA.

#### More about me

In my non-CS life, I'm a classically-trained soprano and was a Choral Scholar at Christ's College, Cambridge.  I've had fun singing acappella through the years -- with Google MTV's Googapella (2014-2017), the Common Chords at the Harvard Graduate School of Education, and Sweet Ophelia at Franklin & Marshall College.  

Apart from singing, I enjoy vegetable gardening -- and if "trying new foods" can be considered a hobby, then it's certainly one of favorites!
